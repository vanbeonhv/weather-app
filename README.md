# weather-app  
## Check weather in any city  
[Live demo here](https://vanbeonhv.github.io/weather-app/)
Api practice with openweathermap.org  
If the site didn't work, the api key could expire.  
You can get a new one at [Openweather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) (registration required).  
Then replace at the line 1 in *app.js*  
Enjoy!ðŸ¤—
